# Youtube clone (Build with React) üéâ
Youtube was the first website where I engaged myself watching tutorials, book summary and random cat videos. I have learnt a lot from youtube (still learning).
I wanted to revise my react concepts so I created this project. This project helped me to brush up my coding skills. I have used few of my favorite technologies mentioned below.
